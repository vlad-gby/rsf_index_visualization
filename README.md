Reporters Without Borders - Press Freedom Explorer

I decided that the data form RSF can be structured better and in a more informative way - in a form of interactive graph

**To run this notebook:**
1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate into the main project directory (e.g., `cd YourRepoName`).
3.  Launch Jupyter Notebook from within that directory: `jupyter notebook`.


I have to include that frame for HTML was create by Gemini, but is highly tweaked and changed by myself in order to accomodate everything in the easiest and best for UX matter. I tried to find the best balance in terms of design, so that everything is clear. Even if the design is not the main part of the project - i believe that's it's often the core thing when it comes to products that are used by a big mass of people from differnt backgrounds - from researchers to usual come-byers, who's interested in how press freedom was changing in their country and what could be the reason of that.


I need to investigate the "average rank" thing across the years, cos it seems like this thing may distort the data before 2012
